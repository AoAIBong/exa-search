    "text": "Google has announced a new AI tool called Whisk that lets you generate images using other images as prompts instead of requiring a long text prompt. With Whisk, you can offer images to suggest what you‚Äôd like as the subject, the scene, and the style of your AI-generated image, and you can prompt Whisk with multiple images for each of those three things. (If you want, you can fill in text prompts, too.) If you don‚Äôt have images on hand, you can click a dice icon to have Google fill in some images for the prompts (though those images also appear to be AI-generated). You can also enter some text into a text box at the end of the process if you want to add extra detail about the image you‚Äôre looking for, but it‚Äôs not required. Whisk will then generate images and a text prompt for each image. You can favorite or download the image if you‚Äôre happy with the results, or you can refine an image by entering more text into the text box or clicking the image and editing the text prompt. A screenshot of Whisk. I clicked the dice to generate a subject, scene, and style. I swapped out the auto-generated scene by entering a text prompt. Whisk created the first two images, which I iterated on by asking Whisk to add some steam around the subject (because it‚Äôs a fire being in water), resulting in the next two images. Screenshot by Jay Peters / The Verge In a blog post , Google stresses that Whisk is designed to be for ‚Äúrapid visual exploration, not pixel-perfect edits.‚Äù The company also says that Whisk may ‚Äúmiss the mark,‚Äù which is why it lets you edit the underlying prompts. In the few minutes I‚Äôve used the tool while writing this story, it‚Äôs been entertaining to tinker with. Images take a few seconds to generate, which is annoying, and while the images have been a little strange, everything I‚Äôve generated has been fun to iterate on. Google says Whisk uses the ‚Äúlatest‚Äù iteration of its Imagen 3 image generation model, which it announced today . Google also introduced Veo 2 , the next version of its video generation model, which the company says has an understanding of ‚Äúthe unique language of cinematography‚Äù and hallucinates things like extra fingers ‚Äúless frequently‚Äù than other models (one of those other models is probably OpenAI‚Äôs Sora ). Veo 2 is coming first to Google‚Äôs VideoFX, which you can get on the Google Labs waitlist for, and it will be expanded to YouTube Shorts ‚Äúother products‚Äù sometime next year.",
    "summary": "Google released two AI updates today: Whisk, an image generator that uses images as prompts instead of text, and Veo 2, an improved video generation model for Google VideoFX, coming to YouTube Shorts next year.  Whisk uses Google's Imagen 3 model and allows iterative refinement of generated images.\n",

    "text": "Meta‚Äôs Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses are getting several new AI-powered upgrades , including the ability to have an ongoing conversation and translate between languages. Ray-Ban Meta owners in Meta‚Äôs early access program for the U.S. and Canada can now download firmware v11, which adds ‚Äúlive AI.‚Äù First unveiled this fall, live AI lets wearers continuously converse with Meta‚Äôs AI assistant, Meta AI, to reference things they discussed earlier in the conversation. Without having to say the ‚ÄúHey Meta‚Äù wakeword, wearers can interrupt Meta AI to ask follow-up questions or change the topic. Live AI also works with real-time video. Wearers can ask questions about what they‚Äôre seeing in real time ‚Äî for example, what‚Äôs around their neighborhood. Real-time AI video for Ray-Ban Meta was a significant focus of Meta‚Äôs Connect dev conference early this fall. Positioned as an answer to OpenAI‚Äôs Advanced Voice Mode with Vision and Google‚Äôs Project Astra , the tech allows Meta‚Äôs AI to answer questions about what‚Äôs in view of the glasses‚Äô front-facing camera. With Monday‚Äôs update, Meta becomes one of the first tech giants to market with real-time AI video on smart glasses. Google recently said it plans to sell AR glasses with similar capabilities, but the company hasn‚Äôt committed to a concrete timeline. Meta claims that, in the future, live AI will even give ‚Äúuseful suggestions‚Äù before a wearer asks. What sort of suggestions? The company wouldn‚Äôt say. Firmware v11 also introduces live translation, which enables Ray-Ban Meta wearers to translate real-time speech between English and Spanish, French, or Italian. When a wearer is talking to someone speaking one of those languages, they‚Äôll hear what the speaker says in English through the glasses‚Äô open-ear speakers and get a transcript on their paired phone. Ray-Ban Meta also has Shazam support as of firmware v11. Wearers can say ‚ÄúHey Meta, Shazam this song‚Äù to have the glasses try to find the tune that‚Äôs playing. Meta warns that the new feature, in particular live AI and live translation, might not always get things right. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre continuing to learn what works best and improving the experience for everyone,‚Äù the company wrote in a blog post . Ray-Ban Meta last got a major update in November , when Meta begun to roll out certain AI capabilities to users of the glasses in France, Italy, and Spain. The glasses continue to sell quite well; in October, Ray-Ban owner EssilorLuxottica told Upload VR that Ray-Ban Meta was the top-selling glasses brand in 60% of all Ray-Ban stores across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.",
    "summary": "Meta released firmware v11 for its Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, adding \"live AI.\"  This feature enables real-time conversations with Meta AI,  real-time video analysis (identifying objects in the wearer's view), and live translation between English, Spanish, French, and Italian.  The update also includes Shazam song recognition.  While Meta acknowledges potential inaccuracies, this marks one of the first commercially available implementations of real-time AI video on smart glasses.\n",

    "text": "Apple Intelligence managed to create a piece of Luigi Mangione fake news last week, thanks to the notification summary feature. It somehow decided that the suspect in the killing of United Health CEO Brian Thompson had shot himself. The mistake, in itself, is not surprising: AI systems make this kind of error all the time. What is rather more surprising is that Apple allowed it to happen when it could have been easily avoided ‚Ä¶ AI mistakes can be amusing or dangerous Today‚Äôs generative AI systems can often deliver impressive results, but they of course aren‚Äôt actually intelligent ‚Äì and that has seen them making some pretty spectacular mistakes. Many of these are amusing. There was the McDonalds drive-through AI system which kept adding chicken nuggets to customer orders until it hit a total of 260; Google reporting a geologist recommendation to eat one rock per day , and suggesting that we use glue to help cheese stick to pizza; and Microsoft recommending a food bank as a tourist destination. But there have been examples of dangerous AI advice. There was an AI-written book on mushroom foraging which recommended tasting mushrooms as a way to identify poisonous ones ; mapping apps that directed people into wildfires ; and the Boeing system which caused two airliners to crash , killing 346 people. Or they can be simply embarrassing The Apple Intelligence summary of a BBC News story was neither amusing nor dangerous, but was embarrassing. Apple Intelligence, launched in the UK earlier this week, external, uses artificial intelligence (AI) to summarise and group together notifications. This week, the AI-powered summary falsely made it appear BBC News had published an article claiming Luigi Mangione, the man arrested following the murder of healthcare insurance CEO Brian Thompson in New York, had shot himself. He has not. It wasn‚Äôt the first time we‚Äôve seen this ‚Äì a previous Apple Intelligence notification summary claimed that Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu had been arrested , when the actual story was the ICC issuing a warrant for his arrest. Mangione fake news was avoidable It‚Äôs impossible to avoid all these errors; it‚Äôs simply in the nature of generative AI systems to make them. This is all the more true in the case of Apple‚Äôs notifications summary of news headlines. Headlines are, by their very nature, very partial summaries of a story. Apple Intelligence is attempting to further condense a highly-condensed version of a news story; a very brief summary of a very brief summary. It‚Äôs not at all surprising that this sometimes goes badly wrong. While Apple can‚Äôt prevent this in general, it could at least prevent it happening on particularly sensitive stories. It could trap keywords like killing, killed, shooter, shooting, death, and so on, and flag those for human review before they are used. In this particular case, the error was simply embarrassing, but it‚Äôs not at all hard to see how a mistake on a sensitive topic like this could lead to making a lot of people very angry. Imagine a summary which appears to blame the victims of a violent crime or disaster, for example. Of course, human review would be an additional task for the Apple News team, but Apple could get 24/7 dedicated checking for the cost of half a dozen employees working shifts. That seems a rather small expense on Apple‚Äôs part to prevent what could be a major PR disaster for the still-fledgling feature.

    "summary": "This article discusses an error in Apple's new AI-powered notification summarizer, Apple Intelligence.  The AI incorrectly reported that Luigi Mangione, a suspect in a murder case, had shot himself, based on a news headline.  While AI errors are common, the article argues this specific mistake was avoidable and suggests Apple could implement keyword filters to flag sensitive stories for human review before summarization.  The article does not contain any information on the latest AI updates released today.\n",

    "text": "The dedicated ChatGPT search engine that OpenAI developed is rolling out to all users starting today, OpenAI announced as part of its 12 days of OpenAI event. SearchGPT was added to ChatGPT in late October, providing improved AI-based searches right from the ChatGPT app and web interface. According to OpenAI, SearchGPT is able to search the web in a \"much better way than before,\" providing links to relevant web sources along with contextual information and support for follow-up questions. When it first debuted, SearchGPT was limited to those who subscribed to ChatGPT Plus and ChatGPT Teams, but it will now also be coming to free users. During today's announcement, OpenAI said that its AI search has been improved over the last few months, making it faster and better on mobile. There's also a new option to search as you converse with ChatGPT, and to make ChatGPT Search the default engine for browsers like Chrome. OpenAI is bringing search to logged in ChatGPT users, so it will be available globally on all platforms that support ChatGPT.
