    "text": "(I wrote this post without any AI help. OH- maybe not- I used spellcheck. Does that count? Lance claims he proofread it and found some typos to correct without any AI help.) Random Thought on AI I saw a great talk on AI recently by Bill Regli, who works in the field. Announcement of the talk: here Video of the talk: here ----------------------------------------------- 1) One item Bill R mentioned ws that AI requires lots of Energy so 3-mile Island is being reopened. See here . Later I recalled the song The Girl from 3-Mile Island to the tune of The Girl from Ipanema. The song is in my audio tape collection but that is not useful so I looked for it on the web. The copy on YouTube doesn't work; however, this website of songs about 3-mile island here included it. In the 1990's I was in charge of the Dept Holiday Entertainment since I have an immense knowledge of, and collection of, novelty songs- many in CS and Math. Today- My talents are no longer needed as anyone can Google Search and find stuff. I did a blog on that here. I still have SOME advantage since I know what's out there, but not as much. Indeed, AI can even write and sing songs. I blogged about that and pointed to one such song here . SO, some people's talents and knowledge are becoming obsolete. On the level of novelty songs I am actually HAPPY that things change- I can access so much stuff I could not before. But humans becoming obsolete is a serious issue of employment and self worth. Far more serious then MACHINES TAKE OVER THE WORLD scenarios. --------------------------------------------------------- 2) When technology made farming jobs go away, manufacturing jobs took their place. That was true in the LONG run, but in the SHORT run there were starving ex-farmers. The same may happen now. Truck Drivers and Nurses may do better than Accountants and Lawyers: Self Driving trucks are 10 years away and always will be. Nurses need to have a bedside manner that AI doesn't (for now?). One ADVANTAGE of AI is that if it makes white collar workers lose jobs the government might get serious about Guaranteed Basic Income, and Univ. Health care Similar: If global warming makes the Cayman Island sink then suddenly Global Warming will be an important problem to solve. ------------------------------------------------ 3) An example of AI taking away jobs is the Writers Strike. OLD WAY: There were 10 people writing Murder She Wrote Scripts. NEW WAY: AN AI generates a first draft and only needs 2 people to polish it. KEY: In a murder mystery the guilty person is an innocuous character you saw in the first 10 minutes or a celebrity guest star. Sometimes the innocuous character is the celebrity guest star. ------------------------------------------------- 4) ChatGPT and school and cheating. Calculator Scenario : We will allow students to use Chat GPT as we now allow calculators. Students are not as good at arithmetic, but we don't care. Is Chat GPT similar? Losing battle scenario: Ban Chat GPT My solution which works--- for now: Ask questions that Chat GPT is not good at, allow chat GPT, insist the students understand their own work, and admit they used it. Works well in Grad courses and even senior courses. Might be hard in a Freshman courses. Lance's Solution --- Stop giving out grades. See here ---------------------------------------------- 5) Bill R said that we will always need humans who are better at judgment. Maybe a computer has better judgment. I blogged on this here -------------------------------------------------- 6) I asked two AI people at lunch if the AI revolution is just because of faster computers and hence is someone limited. They both said YES. SO- could it be that we are worrying about nothing? This also may be an issue with academia: if we hire lots of AI people because it's a hot area, it may cool off soon. Actually I thought the same thing about Quantum Computing, but I was wrong there. ---------------------------------------------- 7) LMM's use LOTS of energy. If you get to ask one How do we solve global warming? they might say First step: Turn me off! ---------------------------------------------- 8) Scott did a great blog post about the ways AI could go. See here . -------------------------------- 9) I recently emailed Lance a math question. He emailed me the answer 5 minutes later. I emailed that I was impressed He emailed that he just asked for Chat GPT. He had not meant to fool me, he just assumed I would assume that. Like if you asked me what 13498*11991 was and I answered quickly you would assume I used a calculator. And if there is a complicated word in this post that is spelled correctly then you would assume I used spellcheck - and there is no embarrassment in that. -------------------------------- 10) If a painting is done with AI does any human get credit for it? I always thought that people who forge paintings that look JUST LIKE (say) a van Gogh should be able to be honest about what they do and get good money since it LOOKS like a van Gogh who cares that it is NOT a van Gogh. Same with AI- we should not care that a human was not involved. IF an AI finds a cure for cancer, Great! If an AI can write a TV series better than the human writers, Great! -------------------------------------------------------- 11) AI will force us to make moral choices. Here is a horrifying scenario: Alice buys a self-driving car and is given some options, essentially the trolley problem: If your car has to choose who to run over, what do you choose? You have the option of picking by race, gender, age, who is better dressed, anything you want. ------------------------------------------------------- 12) Climate Change has become a political problem in that Democrats think it IS a problem Rep think it is NOT a problem Which is a shame since free-market solutions that would normally appeal to Reps are not being done (e.g., a Carbon Tax). Indeed, we are doing the opposite- some states impose a tax on Hybrid cars. SO- how will AI go with politics? Scenarios a) Dems are for regulation, Reps are against it. Elon Musk worries about AI and he is a powerful Rep so this might not happen. Then again, he supports Reps, many of whom have BANNED E-cars in their states b) AI-doomsayers want more regulation, AI-awesomers do not, and this cuts across party lines. c) We will ignore the issue until it's too late. If I was a betting man ... ---------------------------------------------------------- 13) International cooperation on being careful with AI. Good luck with that. My cynical view: International Treaties only work when there is nothing at stake The Chem Weapons ban works because they are hard to use anyway. The treaty on exploring Antarctica was working until people found stuff there they wanted. It is now falling apart",

    "text": "IQ , the developer of AI/blockchain decentralized technology, today announced its Agent Tokenization Platform (ATP). ATP allows users to create tokenized agents that can operate autonomously. IQ’s ATP introduces agents that are sovereign blockchain entities, capable of true autonomy. Unlike previous models, ATP agents operate independently, owning assets, performing on-chain actions, and continuously enhancing their capabilities through tokenized ecosystems. The market for AI agent tokens has exploded in recent months reaching a total of $8 billion in market cap in December. However the first phase of AI agent tokens has not yet fully realized their potential for independent operation, as they primarily serve as tools or extensions rather than autonomous entities. While they demonstrate innovation in tokenization and decentralized ecosystems, these agents often remain reliant on centralized oversight or narrowly defined functions. This allows ATP to address the significant gap in DeFi participation despite a substantial number of cryptocurrency holders worldwide. With over 600 million cryptocurrency holders, only 7 million are currently engaged in DeFi activities. By enabling seamless, conversational interactions, ATP streamlines intricate blockchain processes, allowing users to perform sophisticated DeFi tasks with straightforward prompts. For example, tasks that once required five or more steps across multiple platforms can now be accomplished in a single prompt through these new AI agents that can be launched on ATP. Users can co-own these agents by trading their tokens through the platform and unlock additional features as the value increases. \"DeFi has the potential to reshape financial systems globally, but its complexity limits mass adoption,\" said Navin Vethanayagam, Chief Brain of IQ. \"With ATP, we're building a platform where builders can create autonomous agents that are capable of simplifying DeFi with simple conversational UIs. Unlike other agent tokenization platforms which have excelled in entertainment, ATP is laser focused on letting users create and manage transformative autonomous DeFi AI superagents.\" ATP represents a significant advancement in blockchain accessibility by integrating conversational AI with sovereignty and advanced blockchain features. The platform's superagent capabilities enable the analysis of vast data points across assets, chains, and yield strategies, offering customized solutions for users with varying levels of expertise. These agents can autonomously own assets and perform on-chain actions, unlocking new avenues for innovation across decentralized ecosystems. Platform Features and Applications: Agent Deployment: ATP allows the transformation of AI models into autonomous agents for diverse applications, ranging from DeFi operations to content creation. Tokenization &amp; Growth: Users can tokenize agents to create networks of co-owners that support development and share in success. Agents can manage a portion of their tokens and interact with DeFi autonomously. Decentralized Sovereignty: ATP agents function independently without control by a single entity, ensuring sustained resilience and fostering innovation across the blockchain. Powered by IQ tokens, ATP integrates governance participation and deflationary mechanisms to reduce token supply and reward stakeholders, further creating ecosystem-wide value. The IQ token powers ATP, driving its governance, liquidity, utility, and growth: Governance : IQ token holders, through staking in hiIQ, participate in governance decisions that shape the development of ATP and BrainDAO. Deflationary Design : Platform fees paid in IQ are partially burned to reduce supply, while the remainder is distributed as staking rewards. Liquidity Pairing : Every agent launched on ATP pairs with the IQ token, linking all agents to the IQ token ecosystem and driving demand. IQ is showcasing the potential of the ATP by transforming its flagship AI products into tokenized agents. IQ GPT : Currently serving over 2 million users across 100+ crypto communities, IQ GPT has established itself as a leading AI for blockchain knowledge through IQGPT.com . In 2025, IQ GPT will relaunch as a tokenized agent with its own independent token. This transformation introduces tokenomics that enable direct community governance, allowing users to influence the agent’s direction and share in its success. Sophia : Developed by BrainDAO, Sophia is an AI editor designed for IQ.wiki , the world’s largest blockchain encyclopedia. Integrated with ATP, Sophia will revolutionize content creation by introducing tokenized incentives, rewarding contributors for curating and expanding blockchain knowledge while fostering collaboration within the community. This interconnected model ensures that the growth of ATP directly benefits IQ token holders while fostering a thriving ecosystem. The IQ ATP is initially launching on the Fraxtal blockchain. The Fraxtal team is developing a novel AIVM with Proof of Inference consensus system in exclusive collaboration with IQ to make any AI agent deployed to the blockchain become fully autonomous and sovereign with no single party in control of the agent, a world first. This AIVM technology will initially only be available to AI agents launched on ATP. “Integrating IQ’s ATP into Frax’s ecosystem instantly makes DeFi more intuitive, while opening it up to millions more users,” said Sam Kazemian, founder and CEO of Frax. “We’re eliminating the gap between complexity and accessibility, setting the stage to onboard the next billion users to crypto.”",
    "summary": "IQ has announced its Agent Tokenization Platform (ATP), a new Web3 protocol for creating and managing autonomous AI agents.  These agents can perform on-chain actions, own assets, and improve their capabilities within tokenized ecosystems.  ATP aims to simplify complex DeFi tasks through conversational interfaces, addressing the limited DeFi participation despite a large number of cryptocurrency holders.  The platform focuses on creating DeFi-focused AI superagents, unlike other platforms primarily used for entertainment.\n"

    "text": "In a series of Threads posts this afternoon, Instagram head Adam Mosseri says users shouldn’t trust images they see online because AI is “clearly producing” content that’s easily mistaken for reality. Because of that, he says users should consider the source, and social platforms should help with that. “Our role as internet platforms is to label content generated as AI as best we can,” Mosseri writes, but he admits “some content” will be missed by those labels. Because of that, platforms “must also provide context about who is sharing” so users can decide how much to trust their content. Just as it’s good to remember that chatbots will confidently lie to you before you trust an AI-powered search engine , checking whether posted claims or images come from a reputable account can help you consider their veracity. At the moment, Meta’s platforms don’t offer much of the sort of context Mosseri posted about today, although the company recently hinted at big coming changes to its content rules. What Mosseri describes sounds closer to user-led moderation like Community Notes on X and YouTube or Bluesky’s custom moderation filters . Whether Meta plans to introduce anything like those isn’t known, but then again, it has been known to take pages from Bluesky’s book.",

    "text": "President-elect Donald Trump has surrounded himself with Silicon Valley entrepreneurs — including Elon Musk, Marc Andreessen, and David Sacks — who are now advising him on technology and other issues. When it comes to AI, this crew of technologists is fairly aligned on the need for rapid development and adoption of AI throughout the U.S. However, there’s one AI safety issue this group brings up quite a bit: the threat of AI “censorship” from Big Tech. Trump’s Silicon Valley advisers could make the responses of AI chatbots a new battleground for conservatives to fight their ongoing culture war with tech companies. AI censorship is a term used to describe how tech companies put their thumb on the scale with their AI chatbots’ answers in order to conform to certain politics, or push their own. Others might call it content moderation, which often refers to the same thing but has a very different connotation. Much like social media and search algorithms, getting AI answers right for live news events and controversial subjects is a constantly moving target. For the last decade, conservatives have repeatedly criticized Big Tech for caving to government pressures and censoring their social media platforms and services. However, some tech executives have begun to moderate their positions in public. For example, ahead of the 2024 election, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologized to Congress for bending to the Biden administration’s pressure to aggressively moderate content related to COVID-19. Shortly after, the Meta CEO said he’d made a “20-year political mistake” by taking too much responsibility for problems that were out of his company’s control — and said he wouldn’t be making those mistakes again . But according to Trump’s tech advisers, AI chatbots represent an even greater threat to free speech, and potentially a more powerful way to effect control over speech. Instead of skewing a search or feed algorithm toward a desired outcome, such as downranking vaccine disinformation, tech companies can now just give you a single, clear answer that doesn’t include it. In recent months, Musk, Andreessen, and Sacks have spoken out against AI censorship in podcasts, interviews, and social media posts. While we don’t know how exactly they’re advising Trump, their publicly stated beliefs could reveal the conversations they’re having behind closed doors in Washington, D.C., and Mar-a-Lago. “This is my belief, and what I’ve been trying to tell people in Washington, which is if you thought social media censorship was bad, [AI] has the potential to be a thousand times worse,” said a16z co-founder Marc Andreessen in a recent interview with Joe Rogan. “If you wanted to create the ultimate dystopian world, you’d have a world where everything is controlled by an AI that’s been programmed to lie,” said Andreessen in another recent interview with Bari Weiss . Andreessen also disclosed to Weiss that he has spent roughly half his time with Trump’s team since the election happened, offering advice on technology and business. “[Andreessen] explained the dystopian path we were on with AI,” said former PayPal COO and Craft Ventures co-founder, David Sacks, in a recent post on X shortly after he was appointed to be Trump’s AI and crypto czar. “But the timeline split, and we’re on a different path now.” On All In — the popular podcast Sacks hosts alongside other influential venture capitalists — Trump’s new AI adviser has repeatedly criticized Google and OpenAI for, as the show’s hosts describe it, forcing AI chatbots to be politically correct. “One of the concerns about ChatGPT early on was that it was programmed to be woke, and that it wasn’t giving people truthful answers about a lot of things. The censorship was being built into the answers,” said Sacks on an episode of All In from November 2023 . Despite Sacks’ claims, even Elon Musk admits xAI’s chatbot is often more politically correct than he’d like. It’s not because Grok was “programmed to be woke,” but more likely a reality of training AI on the open internet. That said, Sacks is making it more clear every day that “AI truthfulness” is something he’s focused on. “That’s how you get Black George Washington at Google” The most cited case of AI censorship was when Google Gemini’s AI image generator generated multiracial images for queries such as “U.S. founding fathers” and “German soldiers in WWII,” which were obviously inaccurate. An image generated by Twitter user Patrick Ganley, using Gemini. Image Credits: Gemini / Patrick Ganley But there are other examples of companies influencing specific results. Most recently, users found out that ChatGPT just won’t answer questions about certain names , and OpenAI admitted that at least one of those names triggered internal privacy tools. At another point, Google’s and Microsoft’s AI chatbots refused to say who won the 2020 U.S. election . During the 2024 election, almost every AI system refused to answer questions about election results, except for Perplexity and Grok . For some of these examples, the tech companies argued they were making a safe and responsible choice for their users. In some cases, that may be true — Grok hallucinated about the outcome of the 2024 election before votes had even been counted . But the Gemini incident stuck out; it caused Google to turn off Gemini’s ability to generate images of people — something the free version of Gemini still cannot do. Google referred to that incident as a mistake and apologized for “missing the mark.” Andreessen and Sacks don’t see it this way. Both venture capitalists have said that Google didn’t miss the mark at all, but rather, hit it a little too obviously. They considered it a pivotal mask-off moment for Google. “The people running Google AI are smuggling in their preferences and their biases, and those biases are extremely liberal,” said Sacks on an episode of All In from February 2024, responding to the Gemini incident. “Do I think they’re going to get rid of the bias? No, they’re going to make it more subtle. That is what I think is disturbing about it.” “It’s 100% intentional; that’s how you get Black George Washington at Google,” said Andreessen in the recent interview with Weiss , rehashing the Gemini incident. “This goes directly to Elon’s argument, which is that at the core of this, you have to train the AI to lie [i.e., to produce answers like Gemini’s].” As Andreessen mentions, Elon Musk has been outspoken against “woke AI chatbots.” Musk originally created his well-funded AI startup, xAI, in 2023 to oppose OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which the billionaire said at the time was infected with the “woke mind virus.” He ultimately created Grok, an AI chatbot with notably fewer safeguards than other leading chatbots. “I’m going to start something which you call TruthGPT or a maximum truth-seeking AI that tries to understand the nature of the universe,” said Musk in an interview with Fox from 2023. When Musk launched Grok, Sacks applauded the effort: “Having something like Grok around will — at a minimum — keep OpenAI honest and keep ChatGPT honest,” said Trump’s AI czar in an All In episode from November 2023 . Now, Musk is doing more than just keeping ChatGPT honest. He has raised more than $12 billion to fund xAI and compete with OpenAI. He’s also suing Sam Altman’s startup and Microsoft, potentially halting OpenAI’s for-profit transition. Musk’s influence on conservative government officials has already shown to carry weight in other areas. Texas attorney general Ken Paxton is investigating a group of advertisers that allegedly boycotted Elon Musk’s X. Musk previously sued the same advertising group, and since then, some of the companies have resumed advertising on his platform. It’s not clear what Trump and other Republicans could do if they actually wanted to investigate OpenAI or Google for AI censorship. It could be investigations by expert agencies, legal challenges, or perhaps just a cultural issue that Trump can press on for the next four years. Regardless of the path forward, Trump’s Silicon Valley advisers are not mincing words on this issue today. “Elon, with the Twitter files, did a privatized version of what now needs to happen broadly,” said Andreessen to Weiss , referring to Musk’s allegations of censorship at Twitter . “We, the American population, need to find out what’s been happening all this time, specifically about this intertwining of government pressure with censorship … There needs to be consequences.”",

    "text": "AI agents are supposed to be the next big thing in AI, but there isn’t an exact definition of what they are. To this point, people can’t agree on what exactly constitutes an AI agent. At its simplest, an AI agent is best described as AI-fueled software that does a series of jobs for you that a human customer service agent, HR person or IT help desk employee might have done in the past, although it could ultimately involve any task. You ask it to do things, and it does them for you, sometimes crossing multiple systems and going well beyond simply answering questions. For example, Perplexity last month released an AI agent that helps people do their holiday shopping (and it’s not the only one ). And Google last week announced its first AI agent, called Project Mariner , which can be used to find flights and hotels, shop for household items, find recipes, and other tasks. Seems simple enough, right? Yet it is complicated by a lack of clarity. Even among the tech giants, there isn’t a consensus. Google sees them as task-based assistants depending on the job: coding help for developers; helping marketers create a color scheme; assisting an IT pro in tracking down an issue by querying log data. For Asana, an agent may act like an extra employee , taking care of assigned tasks like any good co-worker. Sierra, a startup founded by former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor and Google vet Clay Bavor, sees agents as customer experience tools, helping people achieve actions that go well beyond the chatbots of yesteryear to help solve more complex sets of problems. This lack of a cohesive definition does leave room for confusion over exactly what these things are going to do, but regardless of how they’re defined, the agents are for helping complete tasks in an automated way with as little human interaction as possible. Rudina Seseri, founder and managing partner at Glasswing Ventures, says it’s early days and that could account for the lack of agreement. “There is no single definition of what an ‘AI agent’ is. However, the most frequent view is that an agent is an intelligent software system designed to perceive its environment, reason about it, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific objectives autonomously,” Seseri told TechCrunch. She says they use a number of AI technologies to make that happen. “These systems incorporate various AI/ML techniques such as natural language processing, machine learning, and computer vision to operate in dynamic domains, autonomously or alongside other agents and human users.” Aaron Levie, co-founder and CEO at Box, says that over time, as AI becomes more capable, AI agents will be able to do much more on behalf of humans, and there are already dynamics at play that will drive that evolution. “With AI agents, there are multiple components to a self-reinforcing flywheel that will serve to dramatically improve what AI Agents can accomplish in the near and long-term: GPU price/performance, model efficiency, model quality and intelligence, AI frameworks and infrastructure improvements,” Levie wrote on LinkedIn recently. That’s an optimistic take on the technology that assumes growth will happen in all these areas, when that’s not necessarily a given. MIT robotics pioneer Rodney Brooks pointed out in a recent TechCrunch interview that AI has to deal with much tougher problems than most technology, and it won’t necessarily grow in the same rapid way as, say, chips under Moore’s law have. “When a human sees an AI system perform a task, they immediately generalize it to things that are similar and make an estimate of the competence of the AI system; not just the performance on that, but the competence around that,” Brooks said during that interview. “And they’re usually very over-optimistic, and that’s because they use a model of a person’s performance on a task.” The problem is that crossing systems is hard, and this is complicated by the fact that some legacy systems lack basic API access. While we are seeing steady improvements that Levie alluded to, getting software to access multiple systems while solving problems it may encounter along the way could prove more challenging than many think. If that’s the case, everyone could be overestimating what AI agents should be able to do. David Cushman, a research leader at HFS Research, sees the current crop of bots more like Asana does: assistants that help humans complete certain tasks in the interest of achieving some sort of user-defined strategic goal. The challenge is helping a machine handle contingencies in a truly automated way, and we are clearly not anywhere close to that yet. “I think it’s the next step,” he said. “It’s where AI is operating independently and effectively at scale. So this is where humans set the guidelines, the guardrails, and apply multiple technologies to take the human out of the loop — when everything has been about keeping the human in the loop with GenAI,” he said. So the key here, he said, is to let the AI agent take over and apply true automation. Jon Turow, a partner at Madrona Ventures, says this is going to require the creation of an AI agent infrastructure, a tech stack designed specifically for creating the agents (however you define them). In a recent blog post, Turow outlined examples of AI agents currently working in the wild and how they are being built today. In Turow’s view, the growing proliferation of AI agents — and he admits, too, that the definition is still a bit elusive — requires a tech stack like any other technology. “All of this means that our industry has work to do to build infrastructure that supports AI agents and the applications that rely upon them,” he wrote in the piece. “Over time, reasoning will gradually improve, frontier models will come to steer more of the workflows, and developers will want to focus on product and data — the things that differentiate them. They want the underlying platform to ‘just work’ with scale, performance, and reliability.” One other thing to keep in mind here is that it’s probably going to take multiple models, rather than a single LLM, to make agents work, and this makes sense if you think about these agents as a collection of different tasks. “I don’t think right now any single large language model, at least publicly available, monolithic large language model, is able to handle agentic tasks. I don’t think that they can yet do the multi-step reasoning that would really make me excited about an agentic future. I think we’re getting closer, but it’s just not there yet,” said Fred Havemeyer, head of U.S. AI and software research at Macquarie US Equity Research. “I do think the most effective agents will likely be multiple collections of multiple different models with a routing layer that sends requests or prompts to the most effective agent and model. And I think it would be kind of like an interesting [automated] supervisor, delegating kind of role.” Ultimately for Havemeyer, the industry is working toward this goal of agents operating independently. “As I’m thinking about the future of agents, I want to see and I’m hoping to see agents that are truly autonomous and able to take abstract goals and then reason out all the individual steps in between completely independently,” he told TechCrunch. But the fact is that we are still in a period of transition where these agents are concerned, and we don’t know when we’ll get to this end state that Havemeyer described. While what we’ve seen so far is clearly a promising step in the right direction, we still need some advances and breakthroughs for AI agents to operate as they are being envisioned today. And it’s important to understand that we aren’t there yet. This story was originally published July 13, 2024, and was updated to include new agents from Perplexity and Google.",

    "text": "Hello! I’m here from the future. And I have some news. 12 months from now, all the Big Tech CEOs are still in their jobs, everybody’s using folding phones, Apple made a TV, and Nvidia is the most valuable company in the history of the universe. Wild year, huh? Or maybe not? It’s hard to remember. Time travel messes with your memory a little. On this episode of The Vergecast , the second installment of our two-part 2025 preview, we debate some seriously iffy storylines from the end of 2025. David, our resident time traveler, brings us some big stories that either did or didn’t happen in the year to come, and Nilay Patel and Wall Street Journal columnist Joanna Stern have to help figure out what’s real and what isn’t. Will someone really buy Snap? Is GTA VI going to be the biggest game ever? Will Bluesky continue to ascend and leave Threads in its wake? Nobody knows yet, not even the time traveler, but we have some thoughts and ideas. As was the case with last week’s episode, we’re keeping score. Here’s how it works: each host has to decide, for each 2025 news story, whether it’ll be real or not by the end of the year. Every correct guess earns you a point; every incorrect guess costs you one. At the end of the year, we’ll total the scores, combine them with last week’s guesses , and buy the winner the coolest gadget of 2025, whatever that turns out to be. (We’re going to need your help deciding, too, but we’ll come back to that.) Don’t read the below until you’ve listened to or watched the episode, but for the tape, here are our predictions: Tim Cook is still the CEO of Apple. In fact, all four Big Tech CEOs are the same. (Nilay, Joanna, and David all say yes.) Nvidia is the most valuable company in the world. (Nilay says no, Joanna and David say yes.) Somebody acquired Snap. (All say no.) OpenAI is officially a for-profit company. (All say yes.) OpenAI is a profitable company. (All say no.) The government is breaking up one of the big tech companies. (Nilay and David say yes, Joanna says no.) We’ve had a huge, society-sized AI scandal. (All say yes.) One or more of Max, Paramount Plus, and Peacock no longer exists. (All say yes.) Netflix’s live stuff is working, and it basically killed cable already. (All say no.) GTA VI is a huge, giant, smashing success. (Nilay and David say yes, Joanna refuses.) Folding phones are legit mainstream now. (All say no.) The Pixel 10 is by far the best and most successful Android phone. (All say no.) The Nintendo Switch came out, and it’s kind of a dud. (all say no.) Apple is actually making a TV. (Nilay and Joanna say no, David says yes.) The new Alexa? It’s sick . Everybody’s using it. (Nilay and Joanna say no, David says yes.) Waymo’s currently having its big moment. (Joanna says yes, Nilay and David say no.) BlueSky is more relevant than Threads. (All say yes.) BlueSky is actually as big as Threads. (All say no.) Apple launched a search engine. (Nilay and Joanna say yes, David says no.)",
